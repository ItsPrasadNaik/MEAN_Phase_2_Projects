1. My javascript code log the errors into text file if any error occures while enter the wrong inputs from the user.

2. The code will create text file called Errors.txt and write tha all errors in that file

3. If the inputs are correct, then app will work fine.

4. After the error logging we can get the errors reported in the file.

4. I have shared the output screenshots and github link for your reference.
