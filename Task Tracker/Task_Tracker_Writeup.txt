Task Tracker

In this project, I have created a to-do list where employees can track there tasks assigned to them.

1. This project was generated with [Angular CLI]

2. First run `npm install' command and then`ng serve` command for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
   The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

3. We should run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

4. And then run `ng build` to build the project.

5. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma].
